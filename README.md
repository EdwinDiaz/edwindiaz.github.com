====================
The html files were correctly published through Github.com and linked to one another for ease of navigation. Three css files were used to design the three html files. stylesheet1mobile was designed to show the responsive feature, with alters the webpage depending on the browser used. Unfortunately, the mobile and desktop views use the same css. However, for the index.html file, the webpage changes if it is opened in Internet Explorer or not. When opened in IE, a text at the bottom of the page displays "This is Internet explorer". This will not display in any other browser. This works because of the conditional statement in the header of index.html. This assignment took me three days mostly due to issues publishing mt github page.
