<h1 class="border1" >ABOUT ME</h1>
<p class="border2">
I was born and raised in Bronx, New York. I am the youngest of four with three older sisters. My favorite </br>
show growing up was Dragonball Z. Aside from playing football every chance I got, I made a habit of </br>
disassembling old house appliances just to see how they looked inside. I was fortunate enough to get a great</br>
education at The Bronx High School of Science, where I discovered my interest in engineering. I</br>
currently am a junior studying at Tufts University as an Electrical Engineering major.
